This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.

## Verification

Java 21 and Maven are required. No external API credentials are needed.

- Fast unit, serialization, HTTP/security and architecture tests: `./mvnw test`.
- Full suite: `./mvnw clean verify`, then `python3 scripts/check-test-reports.py`.
- Full verification requires a disposable PostgreSQL database, never production.
  Set `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, `TEST_DATABASE_USER` and `TEST_DATABASE_PASSWORD`.
  The default test URL deliberately points to a closed loopback port.
- External HTTP contracts use local stubs. Email, Discord and scheduled jobs are
  disabled by the test profile. Tests must not use real user data or credentials.
- Unit reports: `target/surefire-reports`; integration reports:
  `target/failsafe-reports`; coverage: `target/site/jacoco` and
  `target/site/jacoco-it`. A skipped build is not test verification.

The CI verification job runs against PostgreSQL 14 with synthetic data. This is
not evidence of compatibility with an uninspected production schema or of a
successful deployment. Container packaging does not replace the verification job.
